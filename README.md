# Arkanoid-Game

A Java-based implementation of the classic **Arkanoid** game, designed with a strong focus on **object-oriented design**, **modularity**, and **game architecture best practices**.

##  Package Overview

- **`game`** – Game loop, state management, and GUI (`Game`, `Counter`, `GameEnvironment`)
- **`sprites`** – Renderable and interactive objects (`Ball`, `Paddle`, `Block`, `SpriteCollection`, etc.)
- **`geometry`** – Mathematical primitives and collision detection logic (`Point`, `Line`, `Rectangle`)
- **`listeners`** – Event-driven logic for score tracking, block removal, and notifications (`HitListener`, `HitNotifier`, `ScoreTrackingListener`)

## Gameplay Features

- Paddle and ball mechanics with velocity handling
- Block collision and removal system
- Score tracking with on-screen display
- Listener-based event system for decoupled game state updates
- Real-time gameplay loop and GUI rendering
